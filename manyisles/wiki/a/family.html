            <p>
                The Many Isles administrative system is called the Family or Familial System (Familial being the more jargon term), and all its services are placed in it. An overview of the current organization can be found in the <a href="family/famstruc.html">Familial Structure</a> page.

            <p>Aspects are self-governed entities under Pantheon supervision, that decide on things like local policy, community handling, and maintenance autonomously.</p>

                    The Family System, devised around the 10th of August 2020, groups the services of the Many Isles (referring to the corporation of all these tools, people and services) into the Hub. Within the hub, various aspects, such as this website or the subreddit, are distinguished.<br />
                    Institutions are groups not bound by aspect legislature, which can perform a panoply of tasks at any level of the hierarchy. This can be at Pantheon level, or restricted to certain domains within an aspect.<br />
