            <h1>Administration</h1>
            <p>
                The Many Isles community is organized under the "Family System", one specially devised by some political fanatics among the Pantheon.

            <h2>Quick Information</h2>
            <p>If you have easy questions, some might be answered by this FAQ. Otherwise, consider heading further into the bowels of our administrative system.</p>
            <h3>How does any of this affect me?</h3>
            <p>
                Very little, actually. Free users or simple Adventurers couldn't care less for the intricacies of our convoluted administration. Useful facts are only that all this occurs under the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxErZV-D1Otk0L4UbP3RZqUuR6ptSj8i3NNNmVxu9LU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Adventurer's Agreement</a>.<br />
                However, if you're thinking of getting implicated in the administration of one or the other thing, you might want to look into the <a href="a/aspects.html">Aspects</a> article, to see what might interest you, or in the <a href="a/leg.html">Legislature</a> article if you want to have a closer look at our "constitution". If you're a <a href="h/partnership.html" target="_blank">trader</a>, we recommend this.<br />

                    The Family System, devised around the 10th of August 2020, groups the services of the Many Isles (referring to the corporation of all these tools, people and services) into the Hub. Within the hub, various aspects, such as this website or the subreddit, are distinguished.<br />
                    Institutions are groups not bound by aspect legislature, which can perform a panoply of tasks at any level of the hierarchy. This can be at Pantheon level, or restricted to certain domains within an aspect.<br />
                    For more information on this confusing system, check out the <a href="a/family.html">Family System</a> article.

            <h3 onclick="showBg(2)">What's the legal base of this? <i class="fas fa-angle-down arrow" id="f2"></i></h3>

                    The Many Isles has of yet no truly legally valid user agreements of any sort, since we are still in the beginning stages and have no need for the innecessary expense that would represent. However, we do have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxErZV-D1Otk0L4UbP3RZqUuR6ptSj8i3NNNmVxu9LU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Adventurer's Agreement</a> of our own, which dictates the basis of the community and the Family System.<br />
                    We recommend having a quick look at this core document if you're an adventurer, since it always helps to have an idea what you're dealing with. As a trader, we recommend that you additionally have a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1CqPuaHVOM2Bz9GsZQ9S9QvrRZmyMFVo6_Iu7fq2K8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Trader's Agreement</a>. If you're an administrator, you should definitely have read or at least overflown your domain's <a href="h/aspects.html" target="_blank">Code</a>.
