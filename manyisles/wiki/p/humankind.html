                The Rise and Fall of Humankind is a massive project of the Many Isles Pantheon. The goal is to outline the entire history of humanity in two printed 300-page books which will be available in the digital store. A less fancy version, but with all the information, will also be available to the community for free. <br />

                    Our loremaster Ginlic kicked the project off by going through a number of histories and overviews and setting the basic structure. Since that day in August 2020, we've worked hard to get the work as far as possible and completed the first draft in May 2021, which the Pantheon finished editing in July. We hope to get the community in the give feedback and corrections before we do our last two editing runs.

            <h3>Progress</h3>
            <p>
                We've finished writing the Rise of Humankind and are reviewing the first draft; there has been a call for community input for a beta-reading run before the Pantheon edits the 2nd Draft.<br />
                As for the Fall of Humankind, we've done a little aniticipatory work. But this book will not be our next major project after we complete Rise, so it'll take a while before we start seriously working on that.

            <p>We're waiting for the community and external readers to do a first beta-reading run for the 2nd Draft, notably checking for dates and historical credibility and consistency. Take it up on discord if you'd like to help out.</p>
            <h2>Basic Structure</h2>
            <p>The initial plan was to make the whole thing a single thick history textbook as a cool thing to have on the shelf and a quick reference for those who work on Many Isles lore. But it quickly turned out that instead, it would have to be <i>two</i> thick books.<br /><br /></p>
            <p>
                The Rise of Humankind outlines the history from the origin of humankind over to the easy split: the Orc Wars, which upturned all civilized societies.<br />
                <b>1, Dawn of Humankind.</b> The early thousands of years of humanity, including the time of Luche's colonial administration. It ends in the west around the rise of the Cuprien Empire in 920 b. OW, and even more approximately around the rise of the Ochebana Empire in the east by 620.<br />
                <b>2, The West.</b> Western history, including the Cuprien Empire's interprovincial haggling, feudal Weluche, and the powerful Archea after 322.<br />
                <b>3, The East.</b> A blurry start, including some Mruggenrykz and early Balebian Kingdoms, then going into the massive Ochebana Empire's tumultuous society and the Denisite naval power. Also some stuff about dealing with savage powers, which the west didn't do.<br /><br />
                The Fall of Humankind, meanwhile, will show the time from the Orc Wars to (spoiler!) the State of Humanity and the race's extinction at the hands of the Holy Dwarven Empire.<br />
                <b>4, Orc Wars.</b> Eastern incorporation into the remaining western states, early warfare, then politics with the Trensandor goblinoids and the war's great turnaround.<br />
                <b>5, Human Age.</b><br />
                <b>6, Twilight.</b>
