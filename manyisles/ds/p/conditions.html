The partner can choose to set all information about an item upon submission, edit it freely, and remove it from the digital store as they wish. The Pantheon may not all alter any information on active items without previous partner consent.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c2" id="h.vcf9i1gfhmpn"><span>&sect;2.3 Pantheon Item Ownership</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Pantheon retains all rights to remove an item from the Digital Store if it does not comply with the Many Isles&rsquo; </span><span class="c8"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1ZxErZV-D1Otk0L4UbP3RZqUuR6ptSj8i3NNNmVxu9LU/edit&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1633453382194000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2WSbHro83AR3W0gJPLsIbo">Adventurer&#39;s Agreement</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Once a customer places an order, all information about the item is fixed. Any subsequent alterations of partnership or item information does not affect placed orders. In this context, the partner now longer owns the purchased items, and is obliged to fulfill their obligation to the customer.</span></p><h2 class="c2 c4" id="h.i66p9wg5umyo"><span class="c15">&sect;3 Prices</span></h2><h3 class="c0 c2" id="h.pf0hlpdegayy"><span class="c1">&sect;3.1 Base Price</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>A partner can freely set the base price of their item. They may (a) set a fixed base price or (b) base price options that customers can choose from. Additionally, the partner may set &ldquo;price modifiers&rdquo; that affect the total based on specifications set by the user, such as color or format.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c2" id="h.e6vjfohazmik"><span class="c1">&sect;3.2 Shipping</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The partner, as the one responsible for sending an order, freely sets shipping costs. They may do so by setting the costs for a specific item and for each country. These costs are never touched, either by royalties or by discount codes.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c2" id="h.l3i1jqlli78y"><span class="c1">&sect;3.3 Royalties</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Pantheon levies royalties of 2.2% on all item base prices, after all other deductions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Some items, namely &ldquo;digital&rdquo; ones, may be exempted from this fee.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c2" id="h.8zriosl47yf0"><span class="c1">&sect;3.4 Discount Codes</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Customers have the option of using discount codes on their Digital Store purchase. These may range anywhere between a 0% to 50% of the base price. Discount codes are important in attracting customers. Nevertheless, partners can indicate how large discounts they accept on their items, or if they want to do so at all. They can also set the maximal reduction they accept on specific items.</span></p><h2 class="c4 c2" id="h.bf2dl8nwo7nh"><span class="c15">&sect;4 Obligations</span></h2><h3 class="c0 c2" id="h.mi15qp4kpb6"><span class="c1">&sect;4.1 Obligation to Accept and Fulfill Orders</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c3">By offering items on the Digital Store, a partner accepts the responsibility to accept and fulfill all orders. They may freely set items&rsquo; prices and their shipping costs; thus, they must accept such payment once an order is placed. Any miscalculations in price or shipping costs are the partner&rsquo;s fault and must be covered by them. <br>A partner must also make sure that they have the items they are offering, or can produce them in a reasonable delay. They can set the amount they have in stock, limiting possible orders; they may say they have more items in stock than they actually do, if they are able to produce all overshoot in due time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">During the fulfillment of an order, the partner should take care to update its status as necessary, namely (a) when they dispatch it and (b) if they receive confirmation by the postage service that the customer received the shipment.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c2" id="h.3x3aangauma"><span class="c1">&sect;4.2 Obligation to Respect the Customer</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When offering content on the Digital Store, a partner takes on responsibility not only towards the Pantheon, but also towards customers. A customer puts trust in the partner to supply a qualitatively adequate product within a reasonable timespan and without unnecessary difficulties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Additionally, customers should not be contacted needlessly. To fulfill an order, there should be absolutely no necessity to contact them. The partner does receive customer contact info, but should only contact them in case of need. Other communication - such as informing a customer of dispatched orders, or recommending content to them - is not acceptable and goes against this obligation of the partner.</span></p>
            <h3 class="c0 c2">§4.3 Obligation of Confidentiality</h3><p class="c0">
                The partner receives private information about the customer, including their identification within the Many Isles and home address. A partner may not share this information with anyone except where necessary to fulfill an order, such as giving the address to postal services.
