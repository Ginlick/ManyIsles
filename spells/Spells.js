If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. \n\nAn animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution and Heroism is 10, and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form. If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.\nAt Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional Objects for each slot level above 5th."
