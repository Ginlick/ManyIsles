The Many Isles is a website designed to offer a variety of tools to fantasy enthusiasts and publishers.
It is a hobby-made and non-profit tool (we don't do ads and only have paywalls to sponsor publishers). Thus, we're always looking for others, perhaps even with more experience, who can help the website and us improve!
Of course, you can quickly find major issues - so there's always work to do!
The live version is available here: https://manyisles.ch/home

#Helping Out
We'd love if you want to lend us a hand! You can check out the projects and issues on github, or get in touch with us directly. We recommend looking up the open-source documentation first, however.

You could also contact us on discord.

#Setting Up a Local Version
We've written a (very rough) guideline to setting up a local version of the website in the documentation.
