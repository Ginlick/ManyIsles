            <h1>Ranks in the Many Isles</h1>
            <p>
                As you might've noticed while first glancing at your <a href="/accounts/SignedIn.html" target="_blank">account</a> page, we use a ranking system in the Many Isles to denote an adventurer's status and seniority. Often, titles are granted by special accomplishments or functions.<br />
                The information here is taken from §0.3 of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxErZV-D1Otk0L4UbP3RZqUuR6ptSj8i3NNNmVxu9LU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Adventurer's Agreement</a>. We recommend the <a href="leg.html">Legislature</a> and <a href="family.html">Family System</a> articles for further information.
            </p>
            <h2 onclick="showBg(1)">Tiers <i class="fas fa-angle-down arrow" id="f1"></i></h2>
            <p>The ranks are grouped in tiers. For information on tier's benefices, see the <a href="/wiki/h/diglib/tiers.html">Tiers</a> article.</p>

Exceptions include the High Merchant, which remains only as long as their partnership is upheld. Titles may be removed if a member breaks the Adventurer’s Agreement or through other incorrect actions.
