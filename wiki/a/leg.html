            <h1>Legislature</h1>
            <p>
                The Many Isles has of yet no truly legally valid user agreements of any sort, since we are still in the beginning stages and have no need for the innecessary expense that would represent. However, we do have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxErZV-D1Otk0L4UbP3RZqUuR6ptSj8i3NNNmVxu9LU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Adventurer's Agreement</a> of our own, which dictates the basis of the community and the Family System.<br />
                We recommend having a quick look at this core document if you're an adventurer, since it always helps to have an idea what you're dealing with. As a trader, we recommend that you additionally have a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1CqPuaHVOM2Bz9GsZQ9S9QvrRZmyMFVo6_Iu7fq2K8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Trader's Agreement</a>. If you're an administrator, you should definitely have read or at least overflown your domain's <a href="h/aspects.html" target="_blank">Code</a>.

                    It is rather important that our users know what happens with their data on this website. This is handled by the <a href="aspects/homeland.html" target="_blank">Aspect of Homeland</a>.<br /><br />
                    <b>User Data.</b> All data collected about an user is that given when an account is created. This includes username, email, and password, as well as registration date and email confirmation status.<br />
                    <b>Partnership Data.</b> Additionally to their account, an Adventurer may close a partnership with the Many Isles. In that case, the partnership data stored (which is not seen as fragile information) is partnership name, image, connected account, description, and status.<br />
                    <b>Storage and Security.</b> The password stored in the database is encrypted and cannot be decrypted, not even those that encoded it in the first place. It is impossible to find an user’s password outside of brute force. Email addresses can only be viewed by account owners, and are never publicly available. Usernames might be used outside of private affairs, as is the case with all partnership information.<br />
                    <b>Removal of Data.</b> It is in the power of any Adventurer to delete any or all content of their partnership, and to delete their account.

            <p>This document is the very core of the Many Isles, as it guides how the community should be ruled to ensure peaceful cooperation and as little exploitation as possible.</p>

            <h3>Validity</h3>
            <p>The Adventurer's Agreement is in power everywhere in the Many Isles, including in child and aspect administration. Local Codes can only override smaller aspects of the Agreement, and the major concepts must be followed by any entity or person in the Many Isles.</p>
