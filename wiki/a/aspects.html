            <h1>Aspects</h1>
            <p>
                In the Many Isles <a href="family.html">Family System</a>, aspects are services - such as this very website, or the discord server - that are available to users, and administrated locally but under direct Pantheon supervision. For more information on Familial structure, see the <a href="family/famstruc.html">Family Structure</a> article.
            </p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>
                The major aspect of Familial structure is the hub, in which multiple aspects representing various platforms are located. For a complete view of the current structure, see the <a href="family/famstruc.html">Familial Structure</a> page.<br />
                Aspects are administered by a Governor, who holds responsibility towards the Pantheon to handle an aspect responsibly.<br />
                An aspect's administration sets that aspect's detailed structure and policies in their Code, however their freedom of choice is greatly restrained by requirements set in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxErZV-D1Otk0L4UbP3RZqUuR6ptSj8i3NNNmVxu9LU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Adventurer's Agreement</a>.
