            <p>
                The Many Isles Fandom Wiki offers a way for anyone to participate in the Many Isles, be it by posting or editing lore or cool facts.<br />

                    <p>
                        Whenever you write a new page or edit an existing one, you fill one of your slots. You have a total of 10 such slots; once they are full, you can neither write nor edit any pages. A member of the wiki's administration will check your participations, clearing your slots regularly. If you're blocked because of this, just wait a few hours, and everything should work again!

                        Markdown is a common way of writing content and representing different types of text, such as headers, normal paragraphs, or bold text. In the fandom wiki, we use a special version called Many Isles Markdown. You can find more information on how to write this in this <a href="fandom/markdown.html">article</a>.

                    <p>
                        Whenever you write a new page or edit an existing one, it is by default not canon, as a little tab next to the page's title informs any readers. Whenever the wiki administration checks a page, especially if the old version was canon, they may "canonize" your participation. If you feel like an article should be canon but hasn't been recognized as such, feel free to contact the administration or <a href="mailto:godsofmanyisles@gmail.com">godsofmanyisles@gmail.com</a>.

                        There are a number of safeguards against sabotagers and trolls in place. Next to the maximum of 10 edits, administration can at all times revert any changes you've made and ban you, blocking you from all wiki participations.

            <h3 onclick="showBg(5);">What does reporting a page do? <i class="fas fa-angle-down arrow" id="f5"></i></h3>

                <div id="5" class="hiddenCont">
                    <p>
                        Whenever you click on the "Report" button in the Page Admin block at the bottom of a fandom wiki page, a notification is sent to the wiki's administration, which will check the reported page for any unfitting content. If you feel like nothing gets done about a reported page or the divergence is easy to miss, feel free to contact the administration or <a href="mailto:godsofmanyisles@gmail.com">godsofmanyisles@gmail.com</a>.

            <h3 onclick="showBg(6);">What are outstanding articles? <i class="fas fa-angle-down arrow" id="f6"></i></h3>

                <div id="6" class="hiddenCont">
                    <p>
                        When writing an article, it is possible to create an outstanding article. These are essentially blank templates with a name. That way, you can insert links within the article you are writing to pages that aren't written yet.<br />
                        Outstanding articles are listed on the wiki's homepage and can be edited as normal. Any links to outstanding articles appear red instead of blue.<br />
                        It is possible to mark written articles as "incomplete". They are then also listed among outstanding articles for people looking to help out, but act as normal articles otherwise.

            <h3>Genre, Roots and Categories</h3>
            <p>
                The fandom wiki is structured according to these three systems.<br />
                <b>Genre.</b> Each article has a genre. It is the article's type; what it talks about.<br />
                <b>Root.</b> When creating an article, you always specify its parent. This allows for the creation of a tree / filesystem which can be followed down along all the branches, so that no articles get lost. It is a rudimentary and arbitrary ordering of everything, but it keeps the wikis neatly organized.<br />
                <b>Categories.</b> Each wiki has its own categories, and an article can have multiple. They are more specific orderings than genres and roots, because they are more flexible.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Write and Edit</h2>
<p>
Before getting into the fandom, make sure you're signed in. If you don't have an account yet, <a href="/account/Account.html" target="_blank">make one now!</a><br /><br />
On any fandom page, you can find a button saying "Write" on the top left or in the meta block at the bottom of the page. Clicking on it will lead you to the <a href="/wiki/f/write.php" target="_blank">Write</a> page, where you can write your article. Choose a title (Page Name), parent article (Set Root), fitting category, and banner.<br />
Editing works similarly, except that the relevant fields are already written in. Modify only what you feel needs modification, and don't try sabotaging other people's work: this will likely result in a ban.
</p>
<h3>Side-Thumbnail</h3>
<p>The thumbnail gives an easy overview and illustration for the article. It can contain short information such as pivotal dates and core ideologies. Both Titling and Thumbnail Text take Many Isles Markdown text; write whatever you please. Image requires a direct link to an image hosted somewhere on the web, which will then be displayed in the thumbnail.</p>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>Then write the body in Many Isles Markdown in the large input area. So as to not waste slots or publish unrefined text, you can use the <a href="/tools/markedit.php" target="_blank">Markdown Editor</a> first, pasting the completed markdown once you're happy with the results. Note that you can easily insert links to other articles by using <i>ctrl+shift+k</i>. Make sure to do this, so our wiki is well interconnected!</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>Add any sources used in the text here by clicking the plus and minus buttons. This is optional, but can be nice for people who wonder where you got your information from. This takes markdown text.</p>

<h2>Writing Tricks</h2>
<p>The primary style method you'll want to use in the wiki is <a href="fandom/markdown.html">Markdown</a>, which allows you to easily write text. However, there are a number of additional commands and tricks which can pep up your work. </p>
<h3>Quick Commands</h3>
<p>
There are three commands you can make to work on the text. They work in all three input fields that take markdown: the sidetab title and body, and the main page body.<br />
<b>ctrl+shift+k.</b> Insert a link with this command. This works like the markup [name](url), but automatically inserts the link to another article in the wiki.<br />
<b>ctrl+shift+l.</b> This allows you to insert a thumbnail shortcut. Choose an article from the selection, and the shortcut for a thumbnail of it will automatically be embedded in the text.<br />
<b>ctrl+shift+j.</b> The tab here lets you create new categories for your wiki (note this doesn't work when writing a new homepage).<br />
</p>
<h3>Embedded Shortcuts</h3>
<p>
Shortcuts are small bits of code that work similarly to markdown and are parsed into something else.<br />
<b>[wiki:children].</b> This command will create an assortment of thumbnails of all children of an article. This works only once on a given page.<br />
<b>[wiki:artX].</b> Replace the <b>X</b> with any article number, or create this shortcut using <i>ctrl+shift+l</i>. It will be parsed into a thumbnail for the specified article.
