Here's a <a href="/accounts/Account.html" target="_blank">direct link</a> to the account creation page.<br />
If you're looking for it from the website, you can simply click account on the top navigation bar. If you're on the homepage, you can find a link to it on the uppermost right tab, labeled "Account".<br />
Alternatively, you can type "manyisles.ch/accounts/Account.html" in the search bar of your browser.<br />
<b>Digital Store Account.</b> If you make a purchase in our <a href="/ds/home.php" target="_blank">digital store</a>, you can smoothly create an account while checking out as a first step.
</p>
</div>
<h2>Create Account</h2>
<img src="../media/Account.jpg" alt="oops" style="display:block;width:70%;margin:auto;padding:10px;" />
<p>
Creating an account is extremely simple; we only need three pieces of information from you.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Username.</b> This will remain connected to you throughout your entire presence in the Many Isles. Please make an NSFW username that you'll still be happy about two years later, such as your rpg character's name or your gaming name. We recommend not using your real name. <br />
You can only use normal letters and numbers in your username, no special characters.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Email.</b> We don't require you to use your normal email that you check every hour and that you're afraid of cluttering (although we don't often send mails). However, we occasionally send important administrative notifications to it, it's your only way to recover your account, and you'll need to confirm it to close a partnership, so don't enter a fake one.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Password.</b> The key to your entire account, make sure you don't use the same one anywhere else. Additionally, feel free to add odd numbers. We can't see your password.<br />
Only input letters or numbers here; no spaces or any other characters.
</p>
<p>
<b>Region.</b> This can be used by other people to know your general time zone, and possibly for matchmaking in our future adventures tool.
</p>
<h2>Sign In</h2>
<p>Some tools, such as the spell list, require you to be signed in to use them. If you're logged out of your account, simply navigate to the account page as shown above, click on "Sign In" beneath the "Sign Up" button, and enter your username and password.</p>

            <h2>Account Page</h2>
            <p>When you're signed in and navigate to your account, you'll find a page divided in a couple sections, which are discussed below.</p>
