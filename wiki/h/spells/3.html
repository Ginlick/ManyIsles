    The spell list, in both saved spell lists and the spell index, serves as a complete list of available spells. A number of actions can be performed on it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Search.</b> You can type the name of any spell in the search bar, and the spell list will automatically update to display only spells fitting the characters entered.
</p>
<p>
    <b>See Spell.</b> If you want to have more detailed information on a spell in the list, click on its row, and the bar on the side will display this spell for you.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sort List.</b> You can also sort the list in a different way. By clicking on the name, level, or school row title, the list will be sorted in descending, then ascending order of the respective column. This may take a bit of time.<br />
    You can't sort by class. If you wish to see the spells of a certain class, simply create a spell list for that class.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Rename Spell List.</b> You can click on the spell list's title, which will open a text field in which you can enter a new name for the spell list. This doesn't work on the Spell Index, and you can only enter letters, numbers, spaces, - and '.
