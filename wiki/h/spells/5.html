    Once you've generated a spell list, you can go beyond it in customization, adding or removing spells at your leisure.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Add Spell.</b> To add a spell, click on this tab <img src="/wiki/media/SmolTab.jpg" alt="oops" style="display: inline-block;height: calc(15px + 0.5vw); transform:translate(0%, 20%);" />, which will open a dialogue box with lists of suggested spells. Those are all available spells, minus those already in your list.<br />
    When you add modules, the suggestion list is automatically expanded with the new spells.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Add Module.</b> You can click on the tab <img src="/wiki/media/SmolMod.jpg" alt="oops" style="display: inline-block;height: calc(15px + 0.5vw); transform:translate(0%, 20%);" /> to open up a dialogue box which allows you to add modules to a spell list. In any Many Isles product including new spells, you can find a code to enter here, which unlocks that module for that spell list.<br />
    If you add a module before initially saving the spell list, any spells fitting your class, race and piety input will automatically be added to the list. Any others, or if you add a module later on, will become available in the "Add Spell" option, and are added to the suggestion list.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Remove Spell. </b> If you open up the informative block of a certain spell on a personal spell list, you will note the "Remove" button at the bottom of the body. When you click it, that spell is removed from the spell list, and added to the suggested spells in the "Add Spell" option.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Rename Spell List. </b> You can click on the spell list's title, which will open a text field in which you can enter a new name for the spell list. You can only enter letters, numbers, spaces, - and '.
