            <h1>Tiers</h1>
            <p>
                Your tier represents your "buying power" in the Many Isles: as soon as you upgrade your account to a tier, you have access forever to that tier's products in the <a href="/dl/Goods.php" target="_blank">digital library</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Purchase Tier</h2>
            <p>
                To acquire a tier, simply purchase it in our <a href="/ds/home.php">digital store</a>.<br />
                Optionally, you can acquire it on the Many Isles <a href="patreon.com/manyisles" target="_blank">patreon</a>. Although patreon has a monthly subscription, you only need to buy it once to unlock all our products on the <a href="/dl/Goods.php" target="_blank">digital library</a>.<br />
                As soon as you've bought the tier on patreon, look in your <a href="/account/SignedIn.php" target="_blank">account</a> page for a block called "Connect Patreon". If you click on "Update", an interface will pop up in which you can just enter your patreon username. We'll update your tier as fast as possible, granting you immediate eternal access to the corresponding premium products!<br />
            </p>
            <h3>Why a Many Isles Tier?</h3>
            <p>
                The good thing about our tiers is that once you've bought them, they last forever, and also on any new products of that tier. You'll unlock an awesome selection of cool products, and your higher tier usually also comes with a rank upgrade on your account, giving you special access to some aspects of the Many Isles community as well. Plus, you support us and help us continue on with our cool projects!
            </p>

                        The Many Isles patreon is currently not in use; the only purpose of purchasing tiers there is the benefits it gives you in the Many Isles as a whole, such as greater digital library access.<br />
                        However, once the community has grown enough, we'll found a team to work on the patreon, and cool stuff will start rolling out. Additionally, even now, your monthly support will surely drive the community on faster and to greater heights!
