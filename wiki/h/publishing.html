            <h1>Publishing in the Many Isles</h1>
            <p>
                One of our underlying goals in the Many Isles is to create, and in light of the <a href="partnership.html" target="_blank">partnership</a> program, we offer users the option to publish their homebrew for free.<br />
                <a href="/account/Publish.php" target="_blank">View Partnership</a> - <a href="/account/PubProd.php" target="_blank">Publish Product</a> - <a href="publishing/pubguide.html" target="_blank">Publication Guide</a>

The <a href="/account/PubProd.php" target="_blank">product publishing page</a> can be found from your <a href="/account/Publish.php" target="_blank">partnership page</a> on, which in turn can be accessed from your <a href="/account/SignedIn.php" target="_blank">account page</a>.<br />
To access these pages, you need to have an account, and have closed a partnership. See the <a href="partnership.html">Partnership</a> article for more information on this.

<h2>How to Publish a Product</h2>

<p>
Once you've <span class="fakelink" onclick="showBg(1);">navigated</span> to the <a href="/account/PubProd.php" target="_blank">publishing page</a>, you'll find an interface similar to the image on the left. It requires four pieces of input, all of which can be changed afterwards.<br /><br />
<b>Image.</b> Anything you think will look cool that you're allowed to use. Only jpg or png.<br />
<b>Title.</b> A cool name. Please make sure this follows the <span class="fakelink" onclick="showBg(2);">publication guidelines</span>.<br />
<b>Description.</b> A vivid tale of the mystical secrets wrought upon the reader by your magnificent module.<br /><br />
<b>Meta.</b> Select the type of product you're publishing. <i>Modules</i> are PDF document resources, <i>tools</i> are hyperlinks to digital resources, and <i>art</i> are images.<br /><br />
<b>File.</b> Depending on your selected type, you'll have to upload a .pdf, paste a hyperlink, or upload an image. Since this is the real product, make sure that it, especially, follows the <span class="fakelink" onclick="showBg(2);">publication guidelines</span>.
</p>
<p>After you've submitted the product, you'll have to be patient for a day or two. We're still in beta, and the trade institution needs to manually pass your submission.</p>

                <div id="2" class="hiddenCont">
                    <p>Most important of all, you should follow the few restrictions we pose on your document. For complete legislation on publishing, see the <a href="publishing/pubguide.html">publication guide</a>.</p>
                    <img src="../media/ProdTitle.jpg" alt="oops" style="display:inline-block;width:16%;padding:10px;float:right;max-width:150px" />
                    <h3>Title Page</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Banner.</b> Your title page needs absolutely to be adorned with the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16_mGvvSYoVYJWNV-SYrAgOOf_FNSEqOE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Many Isles banner</a>, found in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ngOo5Gfe7k-gxWBZourBSUWQunAxiGm6?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Merchant's Wagon</a>.<br />
                        <b>Title.</b> We have a general naming style, which we'd be happy if you would follow. Also make sure it's formatted similarly to the example.<br />
                        <b>Partnership Emblem.</b> Your partnership's symbol (in the example, that of the Pantheon) should be present in the bottom right corner.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>Additionally, we have some restrictions imposed in the document's content. Make sure no <b>self-promotion</b> is present in your product's main body. At the end of the file, you can add links to your private goods, and should add a short paragraph to <b>credit the Many Isles</b>. And, of course, we're glad if you reference other Many Isles goods in your work! </p>
