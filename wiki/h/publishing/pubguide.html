            <h1>Publication Guide</h1>
            <p>
                Complete rules for publishing can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1CqPuaHVOM2Bz9GsZQ9S9QvrRZmyMFVo6_Iu7fq2K8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Trader's Agreement</a>, notably §1.3. This page serves as an easy overview.<br />

            <h3>§1.3.2a, Eligibility of Products</h3>
            <p>For your product to be eligible, it should follow a number of requirements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must own the product presented, or have the right to present it. Meaning, you're probably its creator or co-creator.</li>
                <li>All art in the product is either owned by you, or must be correctly credited.</li>
                <li>The content shouldn't be stolen. Plagiarism isn't too cool.</li>
                <li>It'd be cool if you'd use the <a href="/Code/Intro.html">5eS</a> stystem in your goodie, but we're ok with 5e of course.</li>
                <li>Please keep away from obscene, vulgar or highly sexual content. We haven't made NSFW guidelines (or criminal ones, in fact), and don't want to have to make any. Also, keep your language acceptably clean.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>§1.3.2b, Further Requirements of Products</h3>
            <p>Once you've got the basics clear, you'll have to look at some Many Isle-specific requirements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) Style the title page in correct Many Isles fashion, meaning a similar title script, our banner in the correct location, and your symbol (in Pantheon goodies, the eagle) in the bottom right corner. </li>
                <li>(2) Either (a) add a link to the Many Isles or (b) add the standard Many Isles thanking paragraph at the end of your product. You can perform some self-promotion there.</li>
                <li>(3) Don't use any links leading to paid content outside the Many Isles; links to other products in our digital library are encouraged.</li>
                <li>(4) Keep your name in our general style; eg., "Compendium" indicating playable races. Take it up with the Pantheon if you're not sure.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> OGL and DMs Guild </h2>
            <p>
                All publications of D&D content are completed under the Open Gaming License (OGL) issued by Wizards of the Coast. Under the OGL, you may publish any D&D content, excluding Product Identity content. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>products and product line names, logos and identifying marks including trade dress;</li>
                    <li>artifacts, creatures, characters;</li>
                    <li>stories, storylines, plots, thematic elements, dialogue, incidents, language, artwork, symbols, designs, depictions, likenesses, formats, poses, concepts, themes and graphic, photographic and other visual or audio representations;</li>
                    <li>names and descriptions of characters, Spells, enchantments, personalities, teams, personas, likenesses and Special abilities;</li>
                    <li>places, locations, environments, creatures, Equipment, magical or supernatural Abilities or Effects, logos, symbols, or graphic designs.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, under DMs Guild restrictions, you may not publish the same product on their site and somewhere else, such as the Many Isles. Note that this restriction is not present for Many Isle partnerships.<br />
                These restrictions are further imposed by §1.3.2c, "OGL and DMs Guild", of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1CqPuaHVOM2Bz9GsZQ9S9QvrRZmyMFVo6_Iu7fq2K8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Trader's Agreement</a>.
            </p>
            <h2> Companionships and Partnerships </h2>
            <p>When you close a partnership (the general term for the publishing entity within the Many Isles) from your <a href="/account/SignedIn.php">account page</a>, it is a free partnership: a Companionship, granting you the title of Trader. The difference with a Partnership is elucidated in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1CqPuaHVOM2Bz9GsZQ9S9QvrRZmyMFVo6_Iu7fq2K8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Trader's Agreement</a>:</p>
            <h3>Extract from §1.1.4</h3>
            <p>
                A companionship differs mainly from a partnership in the status that it holds, and its ability to publish paid products. [...] Generally, [the term] “partnership” does not include companionships.
