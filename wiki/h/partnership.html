            <p>
                The overlying "ideology" of the Many Isles is that of creation, and to that effect, we have founded the partnership program, with which any users can - fully for free - post their homebrews to a great and managed community.<br />

Partnerships are the publishing entites in the Many Isles, the profile that posts cool homebrews. Most partnerships are actually <i>companionships</i>, because they post free content for free. Sometimes, a trader produces paid content, which allows them to make money out of it. That's a true partnership.<br />

<p id="4" class="hiddenCont">
You might wonder what there is to gain from closing a partnership. Well, there's a few things.<br /><br />
<b>Ability to Publish.</b> Without a partnership, you can't <a href="publishing.html" target="_blank">publish</a>.<br />
<b>Access to Merchant's Wagon.</b> The <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ngOo5Gfe7k-gxWBZourBSUWQunAxiGm6?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Merchant's Wagon</a> is a free tool with tons of cool resources, especially artwork and styles, reserved for Many Isles traders.<br />
<b>Trader Title.</b> Even companionships grant their owner the Trader title, with all the cool features that go with it.<br />
<b>An Ear in the Pantheon.</b> The Many Isles lives on its community, and as a trader, we'll pay special care to fit your needs. You can easily become part of the greater effort from this stepping stone on!

<h3>2. Submit Partnership</h3>
<img src="../media/PartBlock.jpg" alt="oops" style="display:inline-block;width:30%;padding:10px;float:right;max-width:400px" />
<p>
On your <a href="/account/SignedIn.php" target="_blank">account page</a>, you'll find a block reading "Become a Partner!". When you click on the "Become Partner" button, you'll find the page where you can submit your partnership.<br />
You need to confirm your account's email to do so.
</p>
<p>
A partnership requires three pieces of information, all of which will be publicly visible.<br />
<b>Image.</b> This will be your partnership's emblem, and should be similar to the one presented on your products. It must be jpg or png format, and of respectable dimensions.<br />
<b>Name.</b> You partnership's name is permanent. Please use only letters and '.<br />
<b>Description.</b> Describe your partnership and its goals!
</p>
<p>
Once you've submitted your partnership, wait for a short day or two, until it gets accepted and you can start publishing! You'll get an email when this happens, too.

<h2>Further Points</h2>
<h3 onclick="showBg(3);">Terminology <i class="fas fa-angle-down arrow" id="f3"></i></h3>
<div class="hidhidCont" id="h3">
<p id="3" class="hiddenCont">
<b>Partnership</b> is both the term for an entity publishing paid products, and the overhead term used for any publishing entity in the Many Isles. <b>Companionship</b>, meanwhile, exclusively referrs to entities wholly in the free section.<br />
<b>Partner</b> and <b>trader</b> are equivocal terms referring to a person (such as you, hopefully) holding a partnership.
