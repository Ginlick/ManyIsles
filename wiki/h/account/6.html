    <b>Overview.</b> Your main page is where you modify basic account information. You can change your email, password or region there; below, you also have the option to sign out.<br />
    <b>Discord.</b> Input your discord username here to connect accounts. This allows admins to connect your nickname and tier to your account. We'll soon have a bot to do this.<br />
    <b>Connect Patreon.</b> You can send us your Patreon username through here. If you have purchased a tier on Patreon (note that we recommend using the <a href="/ds/home.php" target="_blank">digital store</a> instead), admins will update your account information.<br />
    <b>Purchase Tier.</b> A direct link for you to upgrade your account.
